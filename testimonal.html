                        <h4>Instructor at Nucamp Coding Bootcamp</h4>
                        <p>I had the pleasure of guiding Sultan Jarrar through the backend section of a full stack development bootcamp where we covered server-side technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB, developing REST APIs, and modern security topics that are essential for today’s web and mobile applications.</p>
                        <p>As an instructor, I was impressed that Sultan always asked insightful questions, internalized constructive feedback, and endeavored to go above-and-beyond with extra learning exercises and optional material. Furthermore, Sultan chose a challenging portfolio project that not only demonstrated his willingness to stretch his personal learning and advance his skills, but also solved a real-world business problem for a customer.</p>
                        <p>With his demonstrated passion for development and his drive to continually upskill his technical abilities, I am confident that Sultan would be a valuable asset to any project team. Sultan takes initiative, strives to understand the “why” behind requirements, and seeks out mentorship when appropriate. Sultan will be a great development team member and I look forward to seeing him grow in the industry!</p>

                         <h4>Instructor at Nucamp Coding Bootcamp</h4>
                          <p>Sultan Mahmoud was a student of mine for a Nucamp Coding Bootcamp - React class I instructed in Fall 2020. Sultan is dedicated, self-motivated, and highly skilled. I worked with him and eight other students through workshops on Saturdays for five weeks. During the class, it was quickly apparent to me that he easily grasped the material and required additional challeneges from me as he worked above and beyond the minimum that was asked of him. During the workshops, he showed promise as he quickly worked through the challenges, and also worked patiently to help other students learning the material.</p>
                          <p>
                             I have full confidence in Sultan as a web developer and I recommend him in that role.
                           </p>
